Tkml
====

Build Python Tkinter applications using XML-like markup and CSS.

Requirements
------------
Python 3. That's it!

Features
--------
* Simple XML syntax to build applications
* Basic CSS support for stylable Tkinter widgets
* Easy implementation of custom elements (abstract or widget wrappers)
* Logic oriented tags (`<for>`, `<switch>` + `<case>`, `<let>`)
* Attribute filtering (syntax: `<element attr:filter1:filter2="value" />`)
* Any attributes can be bound to a variable (only `textvariable` and `variable` in good ol' Tkinter), support for array of variables

Status
------
Project made for fun, so likely to be buggy and incomplete. Note: some demos are outdated!
